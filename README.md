# NorCal Bot
This is the official repository for the NorCal Bot. It is provided to you by [FTC Team 7303 RoboAvatars](roboavatars.weebly.com).

NorCal Bot is a [Discord](discord.com) bot that allows NorCal FTC team members to:
 1. look at NorCal competition data.
 2. look at which teams have agreed to the [NorCal FTC Fair Play agreement](https://www.norcalftc.org/fair-play-for-ftc/).
 3. look at competition registration for specific teams.
 4. participate in community events.
 5. use meme commands.
 6. and much more!

I frequently update the bot in a private repository, but I can update the source code here if you would like. To request a code update here, just DM me on Discord. You can get my contact information from the FTC Discord (Ansh | 7303 | Software) and the NorCal Discord (teeter | 7303).
